Here's a list of things that still need to be done:

Better sounds and animations
    - animations when trains merge, mix, or crash
    - sounds for mixing/merging

Need UI for what happens if the number of levels overflows one page
    Do I scroll? Or maybe organize levels by city? Maybe both?

Need more levels
    Should write a quick python script to port the stuff from my old trainyard to the new json format

Need a tutorial system
    How should I handle this? Maybe just a wall of text? Text and pictures? How to interleave tutorials and levels?

Need a level editor
    Probably gotta still brainstorm this one, and take inspiration from old youtube videos (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbyT_pRzoDs) about trainyard's editor

Need a cool background on title screen (screen saver mode for trainyard)
    Randomly procedurally generated tracks and kind of random trains going through them?
